### Hello Guys! this is a Data Science Project on 
# Predicting the Air Quality Index
## This is a Supervised Learning Project

I have implemented the code by following the basic steps like:

    1.Data collections: from different sources using webscraping techniques

    2.Preprocessing Data : Feature Engineering

Also i will be doing all models on jupyter notebook for easy visulaization of different plots.

    Models:

        1. Linear Regression

        2. Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression

        3. Decision Tree Regression

        4. KNN Regression

        5. Random Forest Regressor

        6. XgBoost Regressor

        7. ANN - Artificial Neural Network

Finally i will make an interface and deploy all these models for the prediction of AQI.
